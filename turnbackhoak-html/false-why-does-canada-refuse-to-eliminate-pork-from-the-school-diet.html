<p>(2) City of Dorval: &#8220;The City of Dorval wishes to denounce this false article and resents this identity usurpation.

<p>(3) Copy of complete narrative: &#8220;PIG IN CANADA üá®üá¶</p>



<p>Why does Canada refuse to eliminate pork from the school diet?<br>
Many Muslims in Canada ask that pigs not be served in the cafeteria canteen and restaurants in Montreal.</p>



<p>Motreal governor&#8217;s answer like this:</p>



<p>&#8220;Finally, they (Muslims in Canada) must understand that in Canada (Quebec) with its Judeo-Christian roots, Christmas trees, churches and religious festivals, religion must remain on private territory.<br>
The Municipality of Dorval is right to reject any concessions to Islam and Sharia.</p>



<p>&#8220;For Muslims who disagree with secularism and do not feel comfortable in Canada, there are 57 beautiful Muslim countries in the world, most of them densely populated and ready to accept you with halal rules in accordance with Sharia.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;If you leave your country to move to Canada, and not to other Muslim countries, it is because you have assumed and felt that your life would be better in Canada than in other Muslim countries. So if we have received you well and you yourself are comfortable with our country, don&#8217;t try to set what is good for us because without your rules, don&#8217;t all of us as Canadians feel more comfortable, and for those who feel uncomfortable we open the door as wide as possible for you to leave Canada. once again<br>
Ask yourself, just once, &#8220;Why do I feel better here in Canada than where I come from?&#8221;</p>



<p>Likewise for Kadrun*,<br> We, the Indonesian people, are already comfortable with the Republic of Indonesia, democracy, Pancasila and Unity in Diversity. If you feel uncomfortable, please go to countries that implement sharia and khilafah. Don&#8217;t make your own rules.&#8221;</p>



<p>(* Kadrun is &#8220;Kadal Gurun&#8221; or Desert Lizard, derogatory name that tipically government supporter of Indonesian netizen use to call their opponents).</p>
