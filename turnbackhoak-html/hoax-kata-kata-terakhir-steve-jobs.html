            <h1>(HOAX) Kata-kata Terakhir Steve Jobs</h1>
            <p>Sumber: Media Sosial</p>
<p>Narasi:</p>
<p>[&#8230;] <span class="s1">“I reached the pinnacle of success in the business world. In others’ eyes, my life is an epitome of success. </span><span class="s1">However, aside from work, I have little joy. In the end, wealth is only a fact of life that I am accustomed to. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">At this moment, lying on the sick bed and recalling my whole life, I realize that all the recognition and wealth that I took so much pride in, have paled and become meaningless in the face of impending death. </span><span class="s1">In the darkness, I look at the green lights from the life supporting machines and hear the humming mechanical sounds, I can feel the breath of god of death drawing closer…</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Now I know, when we have accumulated sufficient wealth to last our lifetime, we should pursue other matters that are unrelated to wealth… </span><span class="s1">Should be something that is more important:</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Perhaps relationships, perhaps art, perhaps a dream from younger days</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Non-stop pursuing of wealth will only turn a person into a twisted being, just like me.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">God gave us the senses to let us feel the love in everyone’s heart, not the illusions brought about by wealth.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The wealth I have won in my life I cannot bring with me. What I can bring is only the memories precipitated by love. </span><span class="s1">That’s the true riches which will follow you, accompany you, giving you strength and light to go on.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Love can travel a thousand miles. Life has no limit. Go where you want to go. Reach the height you want to reach. It is all in your heart and in your hands.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">What is the most expensive bed in the world?</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Sick bed…</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">You can employ someone to drive the car for you, make money for you but you cannot have someone to bear the sickness for you. </span><span class="s1">Material things lost can be found. But there is one thing that can never be found when it is lost – Life. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">When a person goes into the operating room, he will realize that there is one book that he has yet to finish reading – Book of Healthy Life.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Whichever stage in life we are at right now, with time, we will face the day when the curtain comes down. </span><span class="s1">Treasure Love for your family, love for your spouse, love for your friends.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Treat yourself well. Cherish others.” [&#8230;]</span></p>
<p>Penjelasan:</p>
<p>Tulisan itu bukanlah tulisan dari Steve Jobs ataupun kata-kata terakhir darinya. Hal itu telah dikonfirmasi oleh pihak keluarga Steve Jobs yakni adiknya yang seorang novelis, Mona Simpson. Menurutnya, kata-kata terakhirnya dalam sebuah tulisan singkat. Berikut kutipan tulisan Simpson:</p>
<p>[&#8230;] He seemed to be climbing.</p>
<p>But with that will, that work ethic, that strength, there was also sweet Steve’s capacity for wonderment, the artist’s belief in the ideal, the still more beautiful later.</p>
<p>Steve’s final words, hours earlier, were monosyllables, repeated three times.</p>
<p>Before embarking, he’d looked at his sister Patty, then for a long time at his children, then at his life’s partner, Laurene, and then over their shoulders past them.</p>
<p>Steve’s final words were:</p>
<p>OH WOW. OH WOW. OH WOW. [&#8230;]</p>
<p>Dengan demikian, tulisan pada klaim termasuk ke dalam hoax.</p>
