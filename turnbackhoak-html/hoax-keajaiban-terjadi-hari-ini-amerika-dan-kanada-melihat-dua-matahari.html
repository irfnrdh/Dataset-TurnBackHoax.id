&#8220;Keajaiban terjadi hari ini: Amerika dan Kanada melihat dua matahari. Inilah yg disebut: Hunters Moon. Ini terjadi karena perubahan orbit, matahari terbenam dan bulan terbit pada saat bersamaan keduanya berhadapan satu sama lain pada sudut dan derajat tertentu. Bulan memantulkan cahaya matahari dengan begitu terangnya sehingga terasa seperti ada dua matahari.&#8221;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>=PENJELASAN=</strong><br />
<strong>(1)</strong> &#8220;Definisi:<br />
Juga dikenal sebagai bulan optimis atau &#8220;darah&#8221;, istilah &#8220;Bulan Pemburu&#8221; digunakan secara tradisional untuk merujuk pada bulan purnama yang muncul selama bulan Oktober. Hal ini didahului dengan munculnya &#8220;Harvest Moon&#8221;, yang merupakan bulan purnama yang paling dekat dengan ekuinoks musim gugur (yang jatuh pada tanggal 22 atau 23 September).<br />
Bulan Hunter biasanya muncul di bulan Oktober, kecuali setiap empat tahun sekali ketika tidak terbit sampai November. Nama itu berasal dari Negara-negara Bagian Pertama Amerika Utara. Ini disebut demikian karena pada bulan Oktober, ketika para pengganggu telah menggemukkan diri selama musim panas, para pemburu melacak dan membunuh mangsa pada sinar rembulan di musim gugur, menimbun makanan untuk musim dingin yang akan datang.&#8221; (Google Translate, <a href="https://goo.gl/2BQ6q8">https://goo.gl/2BQ6q8</a>).<br />

WHAT IS A HUNTER’S MOON?<br />
Article written: 3 Jun , 2015<br />
Updated: 18 Oct , 2016<br />
by Matt Williams<br />
If you live in the northern hemisphere, than stargazing during the early autumn months can a bit tricky. During certain times in these seasons, the stars, planets and Milky Way will be obscured by the presence of some very beautiful full moons. But if you’re a fan of moongazing, then you’re in luck.<br />
Because it is also around this time (the month of October) that people looking to the night sky will have the chance to see what is known as a Hunter’s Moon. A slight variation on a full moon, the Hunter’s Moon has long been regarded as a significant event in traditional folklore, and a subject of interest for astronomers.<br />
Definition:<br />
Also known as a sanguine or “blood” moon, the term “Hunters Moon” is used traditionally to refer to a full moon that appears during the month of October. It is preceded by the appearance of a “Harvest Moon”, which is the full moon closest to the autumnal equinox (which falls on the 22nd or 23rd of September).<br />
The Hunter’s Moon typically appears in October, except once every four years when it doesn’t appear until November. The name dates back to the First Nations of North America. It is so-called because it was during the month of October, when the deers had fatted themselves over the course of the summer, that hunters tracked and killed prey by autumn moonlight, stockpiling food for the coming winter.<br />

Characteristics:<br />
Although typically the Moon rises 50 minutes later each day, things are different for the Hunter’s Moon (as well as the Harvest Moon). Both of these moons usually rise 30 minutes later on each successive night, which means that sunset and moonrise are not far apart.<br />
This means there is prolonged periods of light during this time of the the year, which is the reason why these moons have traditionally been used by hunters and farmers to finish their work.<br />
This difference between the timing of the sunset and moonrise is due to its orbit, meaning that the angle the Moon makes with the horizon is narrower during this time of year. The Hunter’s Moon is generally not bigger or brighter than any of the other full moons. Thus, the only difference between it and other full moons is the that the time between sunset and moonrise is shorter.<br />
History of Observation:<br />
Because the approach of winter signaled the possibility of going hungry in pre-Industrial times, the Hunter’s Moon was generally accorded with special honor, historically serving as an important feast day in both northern Europe and among many Native American tribes.<br />
Traditionally, Native American hunters used the full moon of October to stalk deer and to spot foxes at night as they prepared for the coming winter. Because the fields were traditionally reaped in late September or early October, hunters could easily see foxes and other animals that came out to glean from the fallen grains.<br />
The Hunter’s Moon is accorded similar significance in Europe, where it was also seen as a prime time to hunt during the post-harvest, pre-winter period when conditions were optimal for spotting prey. However, the term did not enter into usage for Europeans until after they made contact with Indigenous Americans and began colonizing North America.<br />
The first recorded mentions of a “Hunter’s Moon” began in the early 18th century. The entry in the Oxford English Dictionary for “Hunter’s Moon” cites a 1710 edition of The British Apollo, where the term is attributed to “the country people”. The names are now referred to regularly by American sources, where they are often popularly attributed to “the Native Americans”.<br />
In India, the harvest festival of Sharad Purnima, which marks the end of the monsoon season, is celebrated on the full moon day of the lunar month of Ashvin (September-October). There is a traditional celebration of the moon during this time that is known as the “Kaumudi” celebration – which translated, means “moonlight”.<br />

Interesting Facts:<br />
Sometimes, the Harvest Moon is mistaken for the Hunter’s Moon because once every four years or so the Harvest Moon is in October instead of September. When that happens, the Hunter’s Moon is in November. Traditionally, each month’s full moon has been given a name, although these names differ according to the source.<br />
Other full moons of interest include the Wolf Moon in January, the Strawberry Moon in June, the Sturgeon Moon in August, the Cold Moon in December, and the Pink Moon in April. All of the full moons have different characteristics due to the location of the ecliptic – i.e. the path of the Sun – at the time of each.<br />
The Hunter’s Moon is also associated with feasting. In the Northern Hemisphere, some Native American tribes and some places in Western Europe held a feast day. This feast day, the Feast of the Hunter’s Moon, was not been held since the 1700’s. However, the Feast of the Hunters’ Moon is a yearly festival in Lafayette, Indiana, which has been held in late September or early October every year since 1968.<br />
We have many interesting articles about the moon here at Universe Today. For example, here are some about the red moon and a rundown of what a full moon is all about.<br />

Moon Crock<br />
A Hunter&#8217;s Moon doesn&#8217;t create the illusion of two suns, isn&#8217;t a miracle, occurs annually, and online images purporting to show this year&#8217;s Hunter&#8217;s Moon are actually much older.<br />

CLAIM: Photographs depict a rare “Hunter’s Moon,” a phenomenon that creates the appearance of two suns in the sky.<br />
EXAMPLE:[Collected via Facebook, November 2015]<br />
The Miracle has happened yesterday. USA and CANADA saw two suns. This is called as Hunters Moon. Due to change of orbit the sun sets and moon rises at the same time with both being opposite to each other at a particular angle or degree moon reflects the sun so bright that it almost feels like another sun. Effects stays for couple of days<br />

ORIGINS: On 4 November 2015 a Facebook user published the three photographs (two singles and one combined set) and remarks reproduced above, claiming that the images depicted a phenomenon called a “Hunters [sic] Moon.”<br />
According to the claim, the occurrence of a Hunter’s Moon allows some residents of North America to view what appears to be two suns in the sky. However, the nomenclature used was inaccurate, as a Hunter’s Moon has nothing to do with the optical illusion of two suns:<br />
Hunter’s Moon is just a name. It’s the name for the full moon after the Harvest Moon, which is the full moon nearest the autumnal equinox. In the Northern Hemisphere, the Harvest Moon sometimes falls in September and sometimes falls in October. So the Hunter’s Moon sometimes falls in October and sometimes in November.<br />
Hunter’s Moon is just an ordinary full moon with a special path across our sky. Most Hunter’s Moons aren’t really bigger or brighter. They’re definitely no more colorful than any other full moon. Still, many of us do think the Hunter’s Moon always looks bigger … or brighter … and more orange than usual.<br />
The first full moon after the autumnal equinox (known as the Hunter’s Moon) occurred on 26 and 27 October in 2015, not 3 November 2015 as the Facebook post suggested. As for the appended photographs, two of them were unrelated to the full moon of 26-27 October 2015.<br />
One of the most reliable markers of a story later fabricated to fit an existing photograph is earlier publication of an identical picture. In this case, both photographs of a “Hunter’s Moon” were published to an Arabic-language message board on 13 October 2015 (prior to the year’s Hunter’s Moon) with a markedly different explanation of their origins (roughly translated as follows):<br />
Pictures of a strange phenomenon broadcast in Canada illustrate the emergence of a Shamseen sky in Canada, England, China, and Russia. An astronomer said that this phenomenon is very normal and is a result of a convergence with Jupiter and the reflection of sunlight back to Earth. This phenomenon occurs every 139 years.<br />
Notably, the then-recent claim preceding the “two suns” rumor attributed the purported phenomenon to the visibility of Jupiter, and claimed it occurred approximately once every century and a half (while Hunter’s Moons occur annually).<br />
Another 31 August 2015 article in Arabic definitively illustrated that the photos dated back at least that far, placing the skyline depicted in Tunisia (not the United States, Canada, England, or Russia). The image featuring mountains is even older (appearing online as early as July 2008), and offered yet another explanation for the “two suns” phenomenon:<br />
Social networking picked up an image taken at sunrise on Sunday in the Moroccan city of Tangier. Scientists stressed that it is a natural phenomenon that appears at sunrise and results from ice crystals accumulating in the atmosphere, with sunlight reflecting on those “crystal pools” and creating what seems like a second sun.<br />
While the first full moon after the autumnal equinox is called a Hunter’s Moon, that designation is simply a name which has no relationship to an illusion of duplicate suns in the sky. Images circulating on social media along with the rumor were published before the late October 2015 Hunter’s Moon and thus weren’t depictions of that event.<br />
